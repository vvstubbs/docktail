## Reference

Use this section when checking exact configuration names, defaults, and supported protocols.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | - | OAuth client ID. Enables automatic service creation when paired with the secret. |
| `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | - | OAuth client secret. Enables automatic service creation when paired with the client ID. |
| `TAILSCALE_API_KEY` | - | API key alternative to OAuth. |
| `TAILSCALE_TAILNET` | `-` | Tailnet ID. Defaults to the credential's tailnet. |
| `DEFAULT_SERVICE_TAGS` | `tag:container` | Default tags assigned to services. |
| `IGNORE_SERVICE_NAMES` | - | Comma-separated service names DockTail must not drain or clear during reconciliation or shutdown cleanup. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`. |
| `RECONCILE_INTERVAL` | `60s` | State reconciliation interval. |
| `DOCKER_HOST` | `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` | Docker daemon socket. |
| `TAILSCALE_SOCKET` | `/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock` | Tailscale daemon socket. |

If both OAuth and API key credentials are configured, DockTail uses OAuth.

`IGNORE_SERVICE_NAMES` accepts bare names like `grafana` and fully qualified names like `svc:grafana`.

### Supported Protocols

Tailscale-facing `docktail.service.service-protocol` values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `http` | Layer 7 HTTP. |
| `https` | Layer 7 HTTPS with automatic TLS. |
| `tcp` | Layer 4 TCP. |
| `tls-terminated-tcp` | Layer 4 TCP with TLS termination. |

Container-facing `docktail.service.protocol` values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `http` | HTTP backend. |
| `https` | HTTPS backend with a valid certificate. |
| `https+insecure` | HTTPS backend with a self-signed certificate. |
| `tcp` | TCP backend. |
| `tls-terminated-tcp` | TCP backend with TLS termination. |

Funnel `docktail.funnel.protocol` values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `http` | HTTP Funnel. |
| `https` | HTTPS Funnel. |
| `tcp` | TCP Funnel. |
| `tls-terminated-tcp` | TLS-terminated TCP Funnel. |

### Cleanup Behavior

DockTail cleans up the services it advertises locally when it shuts down. It does not delete Tailscale service definitions from the Admin Console API when containers stop; this is a conservative deletion strategy to avoid removing definitions unexpectedly.
